        beef.

        meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of
        tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance
        the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh
        parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and

        extra decadent.
